# Drinking Water Arsenic and Blood Hemoglobin among Women in Rural Northern Bangladesh: Comparing Associations in Pregnancy and Postpartum

This repository contains code for an analysis of drinking water arsenic and hemoglobin among women in rural northern Bangladesh, comparing associations at two time points in pregnancy and two time points postpartum. The analysis used inverse probability weighting to address potential selection bias due to study attrition, especially at the postpartum visits. This portion of the analysis is implemented at [02B_models.R](02B_models.R).

This project has been presented at several scientific conferences, including Society for Pediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology (SPER) 2023 Annual Meeting (see page 184 of the abstract book, available [here](https://sper.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Abstract-Book.pdf)). The analysis was conducted using data from the Pregnancy, Arsenic, and Immune Response (PAIR) Study. You can learn more about the PAIR Study [here](https://doi.org/10.1111/ppe.12949).
